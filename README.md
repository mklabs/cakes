## cakes

collection of cake files, mainly trying to learn [this cool stuff](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/%5BHowTo%5D-Compiling-and-Setting-Up-Build-Tools)

## install

In the root of this repo, run

    npm install

It'll get the dependencies as defined in the `package.json` file (they're
quite a few, this may take a while)

    colors@0.5.0 ./node_modules/colors 
    html-minifier@0.4.5 ./node_modules/html-minifier 
    coffee-script@1.1.2 ./node_modules/coffee-script

### h5bp

Primary as a learning material, I thought that the h5bp build script could be a great fit to play with coffeescript and cake files

Also a great way to play with Cakefile and EventEmitter to deal with node asynchronicity

cd to h5bp and run `cake` to get the following output

    cake docs                 # Generates the source documentation of this cake script
    cake build                # Build with defaults configuration the main tasks: js, css and img optimiaztion
    cake js                   # Combines and minifies JS
    cake css                  # Combines and minifies CSS
    cake img                  # Performs img optimization
    cake createproject        # a simple create project task
    cake intro                # Kindly inform the developer about the impending magic
    cake check                # Performs few validations upon the current repo, outputing errors if any
    cake clean                # Wipe the previous build
    cake mkdirs               # Create the directory intermediate structure
    cake js.main.concat       # Concatenates the JS files in dir.js
    cake js.mylibs.concat     # Concatenates the JS files in dir.js.mylibs
    cake js.scripts.concat    # Concatenating library file with main script file
    cake js.all.minify        # Minifies the *-concat.js files in intermediate/js
    cake jshint               # jshint task, run jshint on any non min.js file in dir.js
    cake csslint              # csslint task, run csslint on dir.css and ommit *.min.css one
    cake css.concat           # Concat the CSS files depending on the @imports in your file.root.stylesheet
    cake img.optimize         # Run optipng
    cake usemin               # Replaces references to non-minified scripts/styles
    cake htmlclean            # Peforms basic to aggresive minification

      -o, --output       directory for the createproject task

This is a quick and dirty implementation, but the following tasks may (or
may not) work

* js: concat libs/mylibs files, calculates a new checksum and uglify the file
* css: a basic @import inline is made, calculates a new checksum then minify
* img: execute optipng over the .png files in dir.images
* lint: jshint/csslint
* usemin: replaces references to non-minified scripts/styles
* htmlclean: html minification

#### test

    npm test

it'll trigger a first clone/pull/build if needed, and run the vows/zombie test suite.

Check the [tests/build.js](https://github.com/mklabs/cakes/blob/master/h5bp/tests/build.js) file to see the basic asserts
